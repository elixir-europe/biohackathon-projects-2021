# Project 6: FAIR lipids

## Abstract

Lipids are a key class of biological molecules that are important in a wide variety of use cases, from stabilizing molecules used in COVID-19 vaccines to cell-membranes. Therefore Lipids are interesting to many researchers and industries.

Elixir has a variety of lipid related databases and tools:
* CDRs such as Rhea and ChEBI (biochemical reaction data related to lipids)
* UniProtKB (enzymes)
* SwissLipids, MolMeDB, LIPID MAPS
* Sachem (chemical substructure and similarity searches.)
* BioPAN (pathways analysis tools for lipidomics)

FAIR (SwissLipids,MolMeDB) lipid resources will improve their Interoperability by implementing SPARQL endpoints. Allowing federated research queries to connect the lipid to the chemical and protein worlds. Answering biologically relevant queries e.g. “Which lipids play role permeation of drugs, Such as which lipids interact with proteins”.

Beyond Elixir we will work to interoperate with PubChemRDF, European Patent Office, WikiPathways and more community resources. We will increase the value of each database and tool by re-using key identifiers, data-structures and a standardized SPARQL API yet allowing the unique added-value of a database to remain at the hosting institute.

We will also link the lipid concepts and queries to BioSchema. Our stretch goal is to demonstrate commercial cloud based deep learning tools working on our open data to predict new links.

## Expected outcomes

SPARQL endpoint for MolMeDB, SwissLipids and LIPID MAPS
Example federated queries linking:
* MolMeDB to SwissLipids
* MolMeDB to ChEBI
* SwissLipids to ChEBI
* IDSM/Sachem to MolMeDB and SwissLipids

## Expected audience

We expect both Schema markup makers as well as R2RML, RDF and SPARQL service developers to join. As well as Lipid and Chemistry experts.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
