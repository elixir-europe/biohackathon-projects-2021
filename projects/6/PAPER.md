# Introduction

Data in the lipid world, while free to access suffers from a number of technical barriers 
to being truly Interoperable in and Accessible in the FAIR sense. This makes it harder
to Reuse these resources.

Team members of SwissLipids, IDSM, MolMedDB, Rhea, UniProt, LIFS and LipidMaps joined by volunteers
met virtually at the Biohackathon Europe 2021 to challenge these technical barriers.
Critically we implemented W3C standards for interopable knowledgeraph databases using SPARQL 
and prior existing ontologies and schemas such as ChEBI and the Biological Assay Ontology.

## Subsection level 2

Please keep sections to a maximum of three levels, even better if only two levels.

### Subsection level 3

Please keep sections to a maximum of three levels.

## Tables, figures and so on

Please remember to introduce tables (see Table 1) before they appear on the document. We recommend to center tables, formulas and figure but not the corresponding captions. Feel free to modify the table style as it better suits to your data.

Table 1
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

Remember to introduce figures (see Figure 1) before they appear on the document.

# Other main section on your manuscript level 1

Feel free to use numbered lists or bullet points as you need.
* Item 1
* Item 2

# Discussion and/or Conclusion

We recommend to include some discussion or conclusion about your work. Feel free to modify the section title as it fits better to your manuscript.

# Future work

And maybe you want to add a sentence or two on how you plan to continue. Please keep reading to learn about citations and references.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of parenthesis, last name and year. If you use a citation manager, Elsevier – Harvard or American Psychological Association (APA) will work. If you are referencing web pages, software or so, please do so in the same way. Whenever possible, add authors and year. We have included a couple of citations along this document for you to get the idea. Please remember to always add DOI whenever available, if not possible, please provide alternative URLs. You will end up with an alphabetical order list by authors’ last name.
