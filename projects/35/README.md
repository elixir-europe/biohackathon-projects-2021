# Project 35: FAIRX: Quantitative bias assessment in ELIXIR biomedical data resources

## Abstract

The design of AI systems for health is a grand achievement of science and technology of our times. Nevertheless, such systems learn to perform specific tasks by processing extensive amounts of data that is produced and stored in large biomedical repositories. The quality and content of this data have an immense impact on what and how AI learns. If the data contains biases, such as skewed representation of certain categories or missing information, the application of AI can lead to discriminatory outcomes and propagate them into society, as we recently pointed out (Cirillo et al. NPJ Digit Med. 2020 doi:10.1038/s41746-020-0288-5).
The aim of our project is to determine the extent of biases in available demographic categories (sex, age, race) in ELIXIR biomedical data repositories, which are largely used in the community to train AI systems. We aim to quantify bias and provide recommendations on how to properly use the data to develop fair and trustworthy AI, including solutions and best practices.
We have recently collected endorsement and support regarding this project from representatives of several ELIXIR platforms, communities and focus groups, namely Data platform, Human Data Communities, Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion group, Impact group, Industry group and Communication.
