# Project 28: Extending SCHeMa functionalities

## Abstract

SCHeMa (https://github.com/athenarc/schema) is an open-source platform that facilitates the execution of containerized Common Workflow Language (CWL) workflows on heterogeneous clusters. SCHeMa adopts and implements various well-established standards, including the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health’s (GA4GH) Workflow and Task Execution Service (WES and TES) API specifications, CWL, and RO-Crates for packaging workflow results. A deployment of SCHeMa currently powers the on-demand computations performed on the Greek ELIXIR node’s Cloud infrastructure.

Tentative work topics, in the context of this project, include extending SCHeMa to fully support GA4GH Tool Registry Service (TRS) and Data Repository Service (DRS) API specifications to improve tool and data discovery and access within the platform, further enriching the support in the platform for the Workflow RO-Crate specification (soon to be extended to account for workflow run information as well), etc.

## Team

### Lead(s)

Thanasis Vergoulis (vergoulis@athenarc.gr)

## Expected outcomes

Tentative outcomes include:
- Implementation of a TRS/DRS-based mechanism in SCHeMa.
- Implementation of a catalogue of already created RO-Crates.

## Expected audience

The targeted audience will consist of frontend and backend developers and DevOps. Useful skills for the participants will be the expertise in backend programming and experience in working with Docker and Kubernetes. We expect to collaborate closely with participants from related topics, like Common Workflow Language, RO-Crate, WorkflowHub and ELIXIR Cloud & AAI.

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
